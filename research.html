                            <p>The user interviews were critical in finding the direction and overall vision for my online portfolio. The questions and corresponding answers were more high-level and directed around the purpose of the project and the identity of myself as the owner. Further questions focused on career goals and the role that a portfolio plays in developing a career.</p>

                            <p>The competitor analysis gave me more technical and interactive input on my portfolio compared to the user interviews. It was here that I began to study which design elements to include in my own site and which pitfalls to avoid based upon researching prominent portfolios for individuals as well as organizations. I made sure to focus on individuals and organizations in the design industry since that it is where I wanted to direct my own personal portfolio. I studied what worked well, what was confusing, and why these aspects occurred.</p>

The synthesized development effort and values of each feature allowed me to quantifiably compare each. The features I chose were core features that I believed were necessary to my site as well as some features that I thought stimulating or attractive to users.</p>

                            <p>I prioritized the features largely based upon the totals assigned in the feature value matrix. Delightful features had higher values and higher development effort, basic features had lower values and lower development effort, and performance features sat comfortably in the middle. The segregation of features based upon priority allowed me to focus on the most critical and implementable features first and made sure that I had important content on the site before I became overwhelmed with more superficial aspects.</p>

The distinguishing feature of this was the emphasis on the motivation behind users in their actions and their overall goals. These were created by quickly role-playing as potential users of my website (hiring managers, co-workers, clients) and figuring out what they would with the site.</p>

                <h1>Conclusion</h1>

                <h3>Summary of Findings</h3>
                <p>	My findings were mostly dividing into two categories: aesthetic and design or technicalities and bade coding. Right off the bat I realized through comments from my peers and reflection upon my user interviews I realized that my site was just plain boring and un-interactive. Furthermore it was lacking distinct character to really distinguish it at all. This boiled down largely to the bland color scheme, lack of images, and very little delightful features to keep visitors engaged. Similar complaints also came up in my user testing. Users also experienced some problems understanding my projects section as it included only a few random pictures, displayed an incoherent structure, and was just overall awkward to look at. It also suggested an underlying problem of a lack of a common clean design theme in my whole site which was only made worse by my miserable aesthetics.</p>

                <p>Under the hood my html code was very neglectful of semantic practices and I needed updates to most of my tags for proper semantic markup such as section, footer, header, etc and the proper placement of items within each structurally. I also had a very tiny error that ending up having a huge usability on mobile when I forgot to include the “viewport” line of code which was causing my menu to be unresponsive on smaller devices despite my inclusion of media queries. On the same note, even when my hamburger menu was being displayed the transition between closed and open was a little rough and unpleasant to watch. Luckily users were very successful and efficient with conducting basic actions around my site, likely due to the barebones nature of it at the time, and had no very little problems using it. </p>

                <h3>Incorporation of Findings</h3>
                <p>Based upon my findings I knew that my approach to improving my site would half to be two-fold, split between updating the organization of the underlying code and breathing life into the display of the site itself. I immediately started researched semantic markup more in depth. Section, main, footer, and header tags were all added and my content was reorganized into a more accessible layout. I reworked my navigation menu so that it would be more pleasant and better blend into the background while still being accessible at all times. I revamped the overall design theme of the site with a new color palette and new fonts. This immediately gave it a more welcome vibe and was overall just a big boost in attractiveness. I also implemented tables along with new images to include new visuals that were severely lacking and an organized system to make sure that they weren’t getting in the way of my content.</p>
                <p>One of my biggest future goals for this site is to continue to study JavaScript and use its libraries to ease the navigation between sections as well as add small quirks to make the site overall more pleasant to use. Examples are smoother scrolling and clickable buttons relating to my specific skills. Another goal and very easy to implement, is to continue to update my project section with more in depth explanations of my previous projects along with a section on my technical skills that I display to potential hiring managers Lastly I would like to add a header image giving further personality to myself, such as a portrait/profile picture, so that users have a stronger connection to myself and my work.</p>
